# HIGH LEVEL EXPLANATION OF THE MODEL
#
# Variables:
#
# `pieces_sold[pii]`: Integer. The number of pieces `pii` sold. Is the minimum
#   between the demand of the piece and the amount of plates generated and not
#   used that have exactly the same size as the piece.
# `cuts_made[n1, n2, n3]`: Integer. The number of subplates of type `n1` that
#   are cut into subplates `n2` and `n3` (horizontal and vertical cuts are
#   together for now). As this is a symmetry-breaking model, the plate types
#   are not only each distinct `l` and `w` but each different `l`, `w`, and
#   `symm` (that marks if the plate can be cut only horizontally, only
#   vertically, or both ways).
#
# Objective function:
#
# Maximize the profit of the pieces sold.
#   sum(p[pii] * pieces_sold[pii])
#
# Constraints:
#
# There is exactly one of the original plate, which may be used for cutting
# or extracting a piece.
#   sum(pieces_sold[plates exactly the size of the original plate]) +
#   sum(cuts_made[1, _,  _]) <= 1
# The number of subplates available depends on the number of plates that have
# it as children.
#   sum(cuts_made[n1>1, _, _]) <= sum(cuts_made[_, n2, n3])
#     where n2 == n1 or n3 == n1, doubling cuts_made[_, n2, n3] if n2 == n3
# The number of pieces sold is bounded both by the demand of the piece type and
# the the number of unused plates with the same size as the piece.
#   sum(pieces_sold[pii]) <= d[pii]
#   sum(pieces_sold[pii]) <= cuts_made[_, n2, n3] - cuts_made[n2 or n3, _, _]
#     where n2 or n3 has the same size as pii, fixing for when n2 == n3
#
# Unnecessary constraints:
#
# The amount of times a plate type may be cut is bounded by how many of them
# could fit the original plate. Note that we ignore the symmetry tag here
# and group all the plates with the same `l` and `w` but distinct symmetry tag.
