dimensions (`L`, `W`), return a vector of all linear combinations (constrained
by demand) of the length of pieces that fit the plate (the returned vector is
sorted by increasing value and no value is greater than `L`). To discretize the

* `ignore_W`: Do not use `W` to exclude pieces that do not fit the plate.
* `ignore_d`: Do not use `d`emand information to discretize (consider
  an unlimited amount of each piece type available).

Old documentation of the gen_cuts method. It was superseeded by the
ByproductPPG2KP documentation, but it is more complete than it and so
was kept here for now.

`pli_lwb`: List of all generated plates. The triple is: plate length, plate
	width, and plate bound (how many of the plate fit inside the original plate).
	The index/identifier of a plate is the same as its position in this list.
`hcuts`: If `(pp, cp1, cp2)` is present in this list, then the model has an
   horizontal cut that divides parent plate `pp` into child plates `cp1` and
   `cp2`. The three values are indexes in the list of all generated plates
   (except `cp2` may be zero, i.e., a trim/waste).
`vcuts`: The same as the second returned value, but for the vertical cuts.
`np`: A list of plate-piece pairs in which the plate may be sold as the
   respective piece. If `faithful2furini2016` is `true`, then this list
   has always the same size than the number of piece types and each
   plate that may be sold as a piece has the exact dimensions of the respective
   piece. If `faithful2furini2016` is `false` then this is the list of
   'extraction variables' and the plates may have dimensions slight
   different from their respective pieces, and each plate may be sold as
   one of many distinct pieces, and each piece may be extracted from many
   different plates.

# TODO: Optional. Consider if changing the order of the variables can impact
# the solver performance. The only problem with this is that current

# recomputation of ByproductPPG2KP.cuts and ByproductPPG2KP.np.
# Some criteria to be considered for the np variables (mostly):
