Given the pieces demand, length, and width (`d`, `l`, `w`), as well the plate
dimensions (`L`, `W`), return a vector of all linear combinations (constrained
by demand) of the length of pieces that fit the plate (the returned vector is
sorted by increasing value and no value is greater than `L`). To discretize the

All keyword arguments are of type `Bool` and have `false` as default.

* `only_single_pieces`: Instead of discretizing the length, return the
  piece lengths that exist only as the length of a piece and not as the
  combination of two or more smaller piece lengths.
* `ignore_W`: Do not use `W` to exclude pieces that do not fit the plate.
* `ignore_d`: Do not use `d`emand information to discretize (consider
  an unlimited amount of each piece type available).

Old documentation of the gen_cuts method. It was superseeded by the
ByproductPPG2KP documentation, but it is more complete than it and so
was kept here for now.

`pli_lwb`: List of all generated plates. The triple is: plate length, plate
	width, and plate bound (how many of the plate fit inside the original plate).
	The index/identifier of a plate is the same as its position in this list.
`hcuts`: If `(pp, cp1, cp2)` is present in this list, then the model has an
   horizontal cut that divides parent plate `pp` into child plates `cp1` and
   `cp2`. The three values are indexes in the list of all generated plates
   (except `cp2` may be zero, i.e., a trim/waste).
`vcuts`: The same as the second returned value, but for the vertical cuts.
`np`: A list of plate-piece pairs in which the plate may be sold as the
   respective piece. If `faithful2furini2016` is `true`, then this list
   has always the same size than the number of piece types and each
   plate that may be sold as a piece has the exact dimensions of the respective
   piece. If `faithful2furini2016` is `false` then this is the list of
   'extraction variables' and the plates may have dimensions slight
   different from their respective pieces, and each plate may be sold as
   one of many distinct pieces, and each piece may be extracted from many
   different plates.

# TODO: Optional. Consider if changing the order of the variables can impact
# the solver performance. The only problem with this is that current
# ByproductPPG2KP forces all horizontal cuts to come before all vertical
# cuts. Changing the order of the constraints, however, needs the complete
# recomputation of ByproductPPG2KP.cuts and ByproductPPG2KP.np.
# Some criteria to be considered for the np variables (mostly):
# how much is the absolute profit obtained; how much relative area is wasted;
# how much is the profit of the a squared unit of the plate used; or group
# them by pii just for making it easier to the demand constraint.

    gen_cuts(::Type{P}, d, sllw, L, W; [kwargs])

!!! **Internal use.**

The main method responsible for generating all the cuts used to create both the
original PP-G2KP model as its enhanced version (in this case, it generates the
piece extractions too).

# Arguments

## Positional and required arguments

1. `::Type{P}`: The type of the piece profits (and area).
2. `d::Vector{D}`: The pieces demand.
3. `sllw::SortedLinkedLW{D, S}`: The SortedLinkedLW containing the length and
   width of the pieces.
4. `L::S`: The plate length.
5. `W::S`: The plate width.

## Keyword arguments

All keyword arguments are of type `Bool`.

* `ignore_2th_dim`: Default: false. Ignore the dimension not being discretized
  during discretization.
* `ignore_d`: Default: false. Ignore the demand information during
  discretization.
* `round2disc`: Default: true. Round the size of the second child of a
  cut to a discretized position.
* `faithful2furini2016`: Default: false. Tries to be the most faithful possible
  to the description in 10.1287/ijoc.2016.0710.
* `no_redundant_cut`: Default: false. Disables the Redundant-Cut reduction
  described in 10.1287/ijoc.2016.0710.
* `no_cut_position`: Default: false. Disables the Cut-Position reduction
  described in 10.1287/ijoc.2016.0710.
* `no_furini_symmbreak`: Default: false. Ignored if `faithful2furini2016`
  is `false`. Disables the symmetry-breaking used in 10.1287/ijoc.2016.0710
  (consequently all discretized positions are used, none is removed).
