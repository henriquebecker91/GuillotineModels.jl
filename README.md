Imported from old https://github.com/henriquebecker91/guillotine-models to adhere Julia naming conventions for packages (old repository was not a julia package).
Mathematical models for 2D guillotine cutting problems. Part of Henrique Becker's PhD (co-advised by Olinto Araujo, advised by Luciana S. Buriol).
