# HIGH LEVEL EXPLANATION OF THE MODEL
#
# Variables:
#
# `cut_edges[PP, PO, CP]`: Integer. The cutting edges. An arc pertains to a
#   flow PP (Parent Plate), its start point is PO (POint or POsition), and it
#   allows one more flow unit pass through CP (Child Plate). If the child plate
#   is zero, then the arc does not have a child plate. Arcs that do not have a
#   child are either: (1) waste edges that connect PO to the end of PP; (2)
#   piece/"final plate" edges that have a nonzero coefficient in the value of
#   the objective function; (3) backward edges that return the flow from sink
#   to source.
# `cir_edges[P]`: Integer. The circulation edges. A circulation arc pertains
#   to some plate P, and connect the end of the plate/flow back to its
#   beggining.
#
# Objective function:
#
# Maximize the profit of the pieces cut.
#   sum(p[CP] * cut_edges[_, _, CP is a final plate])
#
# Constraints:
#
# There is exactly one of the original plate, so its circulation arc is
# available since start, and cannot ever go over one. It must be one.
#   sum(cir_edges[P is the original plate]) == 1
# The flow of a plate must go round.
#   sum(cut_edges[PP, PO1, CP]) == sum(cut_edges[PP, PO2, vary CP]) :
#     for all PP, PO1 + CP length == PO2
#   cir_edges[PP] == sum(cut_edges[PP, PO is the end of PP, vary CP]) :
#     for all PP
#   cir_edges[PP] == sum(cut_edges[PP, PO is the start of PP, vary CP]) :
#     for all PP
# If you cut a subplate anywhere then you allow its flow to circle again.
#   sum(cir_edges[P]) <= sum(cut_edges[vary PP, vary PO, P]) :
#     for all P that are intermediary plates
# The number of pieces of some type is always less than or equal to the demand.
#   sum(cut_edges[vary PP, vary PO, CP]) <= d[CP] :
#     for all CP that are final plates (i.e., pieces)
#
# NOTE: let us define the following special plate codes:
#   0 - The plate is waste. This may only appear at the CP index of cut_edges.
#   1:n - The plate is a final plate corresponding to a piece index.
#   n+1 - The original plate default cutting (vertical) backward edge.
#   n+2 - The original plate vertical forward edge that takes the whole plate
#     and allows it to be horizontally (i.e., allow more flow to n+3).
#   n+3 - The original plate alternative cutting (horizontal) backward edge.
#     It is allowed by cutting n+2.
#   n+4:m - The remaining intermediary plates.
